**Title: Plenty**

Once upon a time, in a quiet town nestled by the mountains, there lived a girl named Emma. She was a dreamer, with a heart full of hope and eyes that sparkled like the stars on clear nights. She spent most of her days at the small coffee shop she owned, a cozy little place where the smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, and soft jazz music lingered in the background.

Then, there was Noah. He was a regular at the coffee shop, always sitting by the window with a book in hand or sketching in his notebook. His quiet presence was a comfort to Emma, but there was something more — something that tugged at her heart every time he smiled, every time their eyes met.

It had been months since they'd become friends, and over time, Emma found herself thinking about Noah more and more. The way he laughed, the way he listened when she spoke, and the way his hand would linger near hers whenever they passed a cup or a napkin to each other. But despite their growing connection, Emma still wasn't sure of the most important thing — did Noah feel the same way?

One evening, as the shop began to empty and the soft glow of the setting sun filtered through the windows, Emma gathered the courage to ask the question that had been lingering in her mind for weeks.

Noah was sitting at his usual spot, sketching. She walked over to him, her heart pounding in her chest. 

"Hey," she said, her voice quieter than she intended. "Can I ask you something?"

Noah looked up, his deep blue eyes meeting hers. "Of course, anything."

Emma took a deep breath, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her apron. "Do you love me?"

For a moment, there was silence. The world outside seemed to fade away as Noah set his sketchbook down. He studied her face, his eyes softening, and then, a smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

"Plenty," he said simply, his voice low but full of warmth.

Emma blinked, unsure she had heard him right. "What?"

Noah leaned forward, his gaze intense but gentle. "I love you plenty, Emma. More than I can put into words. I love you in the way the sun loves the horizon at dawn, in the way the ocean loves the shore. I love you more than the stars love the night sky, and that’s saying plenty."

Tears welled up in Emma's eyes, not from sadness but from the overwhelming joy that bubbled inside her. She smiled, her heart racing as she reached out and took his hand.

"I love you too," she whispered, "plenty."

And from that moment on, the quiet town by the mountains felt a little brighter, a little warmer, as two hearts found their place in the world — side by side, loving each other plenty.
